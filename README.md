## Regression is a fundamental concept in machine learning (ML) that involves predicting a continuous output variable based on one or more input variables. The primary goal of regression is to establish a relationship between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target) to make accurate predictions. 

Here are some common types of regression in ML:
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts the target variable using a linear relationship with the input variables. It assumes a straight-line relationship between the features and the target.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by using polynomial features, capturing non-linear relationships between the input variables and the output.
- **Ridge Regression**: A type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
- **Lasso Regression**: Similar to ridge regression but uses L1 regularization, which can result in sparse models with fewer features having non-zero coefficients.
- **Logistic Regression**: Despite its name, it is used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability that an input belongs to a particular class.
